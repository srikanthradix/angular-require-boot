ngReactGrid
===========

ngReactGrid is an Angular directive that can be used to render an enhanced HTML table or grid of data very fast using React as the rendering engine. 

The API of the grid is similar to that of ng-grid's, and the table architecture (3 tables per grid) is similar to that of jQuery DataTables.

Please refer to: http://josebalius.github.io/ngReactGrid/ for documentation.

I use examples/basic.html to implement features, it is my "sandbox" environment. This file however is always changing (with whatever it is that I am working on) so beware. I suggest you copy this file and set it up your way. I will be creating more examples when I have some time.

Please remember that there is also a documentation site: http://josebalius.github.io/ngReactGrid/

Good luck!
